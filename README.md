# The Drake programming language manifesto

I'm sick of the fact that to use an elegant scripting language, we lose all the
advantages of type-checking and speed that 50 years of compiler research has
given us. And this is me doing something about it.

Drake is a duck-typed language designed to fix the things that bug me about
scripting languages. It is designed for elegance, without sacrificing the
things that make compilers useful, notably speed and type-checking.


See 'How not to design a scripting language' for some discussion, and I'll be
putting together some better discussion soon.
